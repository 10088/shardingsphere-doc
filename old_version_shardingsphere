 When integrating Seata AT transaction, we need to integrate TM, RM and TC component into ShardingSphere transaction manager. 
 Seata have proxied `DataSource` interface in order to RPC with TC. 
 Similarly, Apache ShardingSphere faced to `DataSource` interface to aggregate data sources too. 
-After Seata `DataSource` encapsulation, it is easy to put Seata AT transaction in to Apache ShardingSphere sharding ecosystem.
