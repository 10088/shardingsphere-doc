 ### 2 架构
 
-Apache ShardingSphere 是一套开源的分布式数据库中间件解决方案组成的生态圈，它由 Sharding-JDBC、Sharding-Proxy 和 Sharding-Sidecar（计划中）这 3 款相互独立的产品组成。它们均提供标准化的数据分片、分布式事务和分布式治理等功能，可适用于如 Java 同构、异构语言、云原生等各种多样化的应用场景。随着 Apache ShardingSphere 在查询优化器和分布式事务引擎的不断探索，它已渐渐地打破了实现方案的产品边界，向集进取型和稳定型于一身的平台级解决方案演进。

 ### 2 Architecture
 
-Apache ShardingSphere is an open source ecosystem distributed database middleware solutions, consisting of three separate products, Sharding-JDBC, Sharding-Proxy, and Sharding-Sidecar (planned). They all provide standardized data sharding, distributed transactions, and distributed governance for a variety of diverse application scenarios such as Java Isomorphic, heterogeneous languages, and cloud-native. As Apache ShardingSphere continues to explore query optimizers and distributed transaction engines, it has gradually broken the product boundaries of implementations and evolved into a platform-level solution that is both aggressive and stable all in one.

 Apache ShardingSphere 5.x 版本开始致力于可插拔架构，项目的功能组件能够灵活的以可插拔的方式进行扩展。
 目前，数据分片、读写分离、数据加密、影子库压测等功能，以及对 MySQL、PostgreSQL、SQLServer、Oracle 等 SQL 与协议的支持，均通过插件的方式织入项目。
