 Configuring a larger number of sharding items than the number of servers, or better, a multiplier of the number of servers, makes it more reasonably for the job to leverage the resources, and assign the sharding items dynamically.
 
-For example, we have 10 sharding items and there are 3 servers, the number of sharding items are server A = 0,1,2; server B = 3,4,5; server C = 6,7,8,9.
+For example, we have 10 sharding items and there are 3 servers, the number of sharding items are server A = 0,1,2,9; server B = 3,4,5; server C = 6,7,8.
 If the server C is down, then server A = 0,1,2,3,4 and B = 5,6,7,8,9, maximizing the throughput without losing any sharding item.
