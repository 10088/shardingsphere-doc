      <description>Background The ShardingSphere governance module is designed to provide a more efficient and automated cluster management feature. This depends on the state of each node in the cluster, and the real-time connection state between each node is also essential for automated cluster management.
The heartbeat detection is responsible for collecting the real-time connection state between the application and the databases to provide support for subsequent automated management and scheduling.
Program  Initialize the heartbeat detection module according to the configuration when the application starts The heartbeat detection module starts the heartbeat detection task, periodically obtains the database connection associated with the instance and executes heartbeat detection SQL Process the heartbeat detection result and persist it to the registry center  Data Structure The heartbeat detection result is persist to the instances node of registry center:</description>
