      <description>Detailed Process Overall Architecture Encrypt-JDBC provided by ShardingSphere are deployed with business codes. Business parties need to perform JDBC programming for Encrypt-JDBC. Since Encrypt-JDBC implements all JDBC standard interfaces, business codes can be used without additional modification. At this time, Encrypt-JDBC is responsible for all interactions between the business code and the database. Business only needs to provide encryption rules. ** As a bridge between the business code and the underlying database, Encrypt-JDBC can intercept user behavior and interact with the database after transforming the user behavior.</description>
