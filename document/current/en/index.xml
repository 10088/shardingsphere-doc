      <description>Motivation   Centralized configuration: more and more running examples have made it hard to manage separate configurations and asynchronized configurations can cause serious problems. Concentrating them in the configuration center can make the management more effective.
  Dynamic configuration: distribution after configuration modification is another important capability of configuration center. It can support dynamic switch between data sources, tables, shards and the read-write split strategy.
  Data Structure in Configuration Center Under defined name space config, configuration center stores data sources, sharding databases, sharding tables, read-write split, and properties in YAML.</description>

      <description>Detailed Process Overall Architecture Encrypt-JDBC provided by ShardingSphere are deployed with business codes. Business parties need to perform JDBC programming for Encrypt-JDBC. Since Encrypt-JDBC implements all JDBC standard interfaces, business codes can be used without additional modification. At this time, Encrypt-JDBC is responsible for all interactions between the business code and the database. Business only needs to provide encryption rules. ** As a bridge between the business code and the underlying database, Encrypt-JDBC can intercept user behavior and interact with the database after transforming the user behavior.</description>

      <description>Master Database It refers to the database used in data insertion, update and deletion. It only supports single master database for now.
Slave Database It refers to the database used in data query. It supports multiple slave databases.
Master-Slave Replication It refers to the operation to asynchronously replicate data from the master database to the slave database. Because of master-slave asynchronization, there may be short-time data inconsistency between them.
Load Balance Strategy Through this strategy, queries are separated to different slave databases.</description>

      <description>Compared to other programming languages, SQL is relatively simple, but it is still a complete set of programming language, so there is no essential difference between parsing SQL grammar and parsing other languages (Java, C and Go, etc.).
Abstract Syntax Tree The parsing process can be divided into lexical parsing and syntactic parsing. Lexical parser is used to divide SQL into indivisible atomic signs, i.e., Token. According to the dictionary provided by different database dialect, it is categorized into keyword, expression, literal value and operator.</description>

      <description>Logic Table It refers collectively to horizontal sharding databases (tables) with the same logic and data structure. For instance, the order data is divided into 10 tables according to the last number of the primary key, and they are from t_order_0 to t_order_9, whose logic name is t_order.
Actual Table The physical table that really exists in the sharding database, i.e., t_order_0 to t_order_9 in the instance above.

      <description>Since the SQL syntax is flexible and complex and distributed databases and stand-alone databases do not have identical query sceanrios, SQLs incompatible with stand-alone databases are hard to avoid.
This document has listed identified supported SQL types and unsupported SQL types, trying to avoid traps for users.
It is inevitably to have some unlisted SQLs, welcome to supplement for that. We will also try to support those unavailable SQLs in future versions.</description>

      <description>2PC transaction submit uses the DTP Model defined by X/OPEN, in which created AP (Application Program), TM (Transaction Manager) and RM (Resource Manager) can guarantee a high transaction consistency. TM and RM use XA protocol for bidirectional streaming. Compared with traditional local transactions, XA transactions have a prepare phase, where the database can not only passively receive commands, but also notify the submitter whether the transaction can be accepted. TM can collect all the prepare results of branch transactions before submitting all of them together, which has guaranteed the distributed consistency.</description>

      <description>Totally support pagination queries of MySQL, PostgreSQL and Oracle; partly support SQLServer pagination query due to its complexity.
Pagination Performance Performance Bottleneck Pagination with query offset too high can lead to a low data accessibility, take MySQL as an example:
SELECT * FROM t_order ORDER BY id LIMIT 1000000, 10 This SQL will make MySQL acquire another 10 records after skipping 1,000,000 records when it is not able to use indexes.</description>

      <description>Motivation   As config center manage configuration data, registry center hold all ephemeral status data dynamically generated in runtime(such as available proxy instances, disabled datasource instances etc).
  Registry center can disable the access to slave database and the access of application. Orchestration still has many functions(such as flow control) to be developed.
  Data Structure in Registry Center The registry center can create running node of database access object under state in defined name space, to distinguish different database access instances, including instances and datasources nodes.</description>

      <guid>https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/features/sharding/principle/route/</guid>
      <description>It refers to the sharding strategy that matches databases and tables according to the parsing context and generates route path. SQL with sharding keys can be divided into single-sharding route (equal mark as the operator of sharding key), multiple-sharding route (IN as the operator of sharding key) and range sharding route (BETWEEN as the operator of sharding key). SQL without sharding key adopts broadcast route.
Sharding strategies can usually be set in the database or by users.</description>

      <description>Sharding Key The database field used in sharding refers to the key field in horizontal sharding of the database (table). For example, in last number modulo of order ID sharding, order ID is taken as the sharding key. The full route executed when there is no sharding field in SQL has a poor performance. Besides single sharding column, Apache ShardingSphere also supports multiple sharding columns.
Sharding Algorithm Data sharding can be achieved by sharding algorithms through =, &amp;gt;=, &amp;lt;=, &amp;gt;, &amp;lt;, BETWEEN and IN.</description>

      <description>Motivation   Metadata is the core data of the data source used by ShardingSphere-JDBC/ShardingSphere-Proxy, which contains tables, columns, and indexes, etc. Metadata ensures that each component of ShardingSphere can run correctly.
  The metadata center organizes and manages the metadata in a unified manner to realize the unified loading of metadata, change notifications and data synchronization.
  Data Structure in Metadata Center The metadata center stores metadata in YAML under the metadata node of the defined namespace and orchestration node, and each logical data source is stored independently.</description>

      <description>ShardingSphere supports multiple dialects of SQL using different parsers. For specific SQL dialects that do not implement parsers, the default is to use the SQL92 standard for parsing.
Specific SQL dialect parser   PostgreSQL parser
  MySQL parser
  Oracle parser
  SQLServer parser
  Note: MySQL parser supports MySQL, H2, and MariDB dialect.
Default SQL dialect parser Other SQL dialects, such as SQLite, Sybase, DB2 and Informix, are parsed by default using the standard of SQL92.</description>

      <description>Principle Consider about these challenges of ShardingSphere-Scaling, the solution is: Use two database clusters temporarily, and switch after the scaling is completed.
Advantages:
 No effect for origin data during scaling. No risk for scaling failure. No limited by sharding strategies.  Disadvantages：
 Redundant servers during scaling. All data needs to be moved.  ShardingSphere-Scaling will analyze the sharding rules and extract information like datasource and data nodes. According the sharding rules, ShardingSphere-Scaling create a scaling job with 4 main phases.</description>

      <description>The SQL written by engineers facing logic databases and tables cannot be executed directly in actual databases. SQL rewrite is used to rewrite logic SQL into rightly executable ones in actual databases, including two parts, correctness rewrite and optimization rewrite.
Correctness Rewrite In situation with sharding tables, it requires to rewrite logic table names in sharding settings into actual table names acquired after routing. Database sharding does not require to rewrite table names.</description>

      <description>Seata is a distributed transaction framework developed by Alibaba Group and Ant Finance. The goal of AT transaction is to provide incremental transaction ACID semantics under the micro-service architecture, so that developers can use distributed transactions as they use local transactions. The core idea of AT transaction is the same as Apache ShardingSphere.
Seata AT transaction model includes TM (Transaction Manager), RM (Resource Manager) and TC (Transaction Coordinator). TC is an independent service that needs to be deployed separately.</description>

      <description>When integrating Seata AT transaction, we need to integrate TM, RM and TC component into Apache Sharding transaction manager. Seata have proxied DataSource interface in order to RPC with TC. Similarly, Apache ShardingSphere faced to DataSource interface to aggregate data sources too. After Seata DataSource encapsulation, it is easy to put Seata AT transaction in to Apache ShardingSphere sharding ecosystem.
Init Seata Engine When an application containing ShardingTransactionBaseSeataAT startup, the user-configured DataSource will be wrapped into seata DataSourceProxy through seata.</description>

      <description>SPI Service Provider Interface (SPI) is a kind of API that aims to be implemented or extended by the third party. It can be used to realize framework extension or component replacement.
ShardingSphere uses SPI to load data to the config center/registry/metadata center and disable instances and databases. Currently, ShardingSphere supports frequently used registry centers, Zookeeper and Etcd. In addition, by injecting them to ShardingSphere with SPI, users can use other third-party config/registry/metadata centers to enable databases orchestration.</description>

      <guid>https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/features/sharding/principle/execute/</guid>
      <description>ShardingSphere adopts a set of automatic execution engine, responsible for sending the true SQL, which has been routed and rewritten, to execute in the underlying data source safely and effectively. It does not simply send the SQL through JDBC to directly execute in the underlying data source, or put execution requests directly to the thread pool to concurrently execute, but focuses more on the creation of a balanced data source connection, the consumption generated by the memory usage, the maximum utilization of the concurrency and other problems.</description>

      <title>Inline Expression</title>
      <link>https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/features/sharding/concept/inline-expression/</link>

      <guid>https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/features/sharding/concept/inline-expression/</guid>
      <description>Motivation Configuration simplicity and unity are two main problems that inline expression intends to solve.
In complex sharding rules, with more data nodes, a large number of configuration repetitions make configurations difficult to maintain. Inline expressions can simplify data node configuration work.
Java codes are not helpful in the unified management of common configurations. Writing sharding algorithms with inline expressions, users can stored rules together, making them easier to be browsed and stored.</description>

      <description>Using orchestration requires designating a config center, registry center &amp;amp; metadata center, in which all the configurations are saved. Users can either use local configurations to cover config center configurations or read configurations from config center.

      <description>Notice Inline expression identifier can can use ${...}  or $-&amp;gt;{...}, but the former one clashes with the placeholder in property documents of Spring, so it is suggested to use $-&amp;gt;{...} for inline expression identifier under Spring environment.

      <description>Target Facing logic databases and tables cannot be executed directly in actual databases. SQL rewrite is used to rewrite logic SQL into rightly executable ones in actual databases, including two parts, correctness rewrite and optimization rewrite. rewrite tests are for these targets.
Test The rewrite tests are in the test folder under sharding-core/sharding-core-rewrite . Followings are the main part for rewrite tests:
 test engine environment configuration assert data  Test engine is the entrance of rewrite tests, just like other test engines, through Junit Parameterized, read every and each data in the xml file under the target test type in test\resources, and then assert by the engine one by one</description>

      <description>Background APM is the abbreviation for application performance monitoring. Currently, main APM functions lie in the performance diagnosis of distributed systems, including chain demonstration, application topology analysis and so on.
ShardingSphere is not responsible for gathering, storing and demonstrating APM data, but sends the core information of SQL parsing and enforcement to APM to process. In other words, ShardingSphere is only responsible for generating valuable data and submitting it to relevant systems through standard protocol.</description>

      <guid>https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/features/sharding/concept/key-generator/</guid>
      <description>Motivation In the development of traditional database software, the automatic sequence generation technology is a basic requirement. All kinds of databases have provided corresponding support for this requirement, such as MySQL auto-increment key, Oracle auto-increment sequence and so on. It is a tricky problem that there is only one sequence generated by different data nodes after sharding. Auto-increment keys in different physical tables in the same logic table can not perceive each other and thereby generate repeated sequences.</description>

      <description>Result merger refers to merging multi-data result set acquired from all the data nodes as one result set and returning it to the request end rightly.
In function, the result merger supported by ShardingSphere can be divided into five kinds, iteration, order-by, group-by, pagination and aggregation, which are in composition relation rather than clash relation. In structure, it can be divided into stream merger, memory merger and decorator merger, among which, stream merger and memory merger clash with each other; decorator merger can be further processed based on stream merger and memory merger.</description>

      <description>Target The performance of ShardingSphere-JDBC，ShardingSphere-Proxy and MySQL would be compared here. INSERT &amp;amp; UPDATE &amp;amp; DELETE which regarded as a set of associated operation and SELECT which focus on sharding optimization are used to evaluate performance for the basic scenarios (single route, master slave &amp;amp; encrypt &amp;amp; sharding, full route). While another set of associated operation, INSERT &amp;amp; SELECT &amp;amp; DELETE, is used to evaluate performance for master slave. To achieve the result better, these tests are performed with jmeter which based on a certain amount of data with 20 concurrent threads for 30 minutes, and one MySQL has been deployed on one machine, while the scenario of MySQL used for comparison is deployed on one machine with one instance.</description>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://shardingsphere.apache.org/document/current/en/features/sharding/concept/hint/</guid>
      <description>Motivation Apache ShardingSphere can be compatible with SQL in way of parsing SQL statements and extracting columns and values to shard. If SQL does not have sharding conditions, it is impossible to shard without full route.
In some applications, sharding conditions are not in SQL but in external business logic. So it requires to designate sharding result externally, which is referred to as Hint in ShardingSphere.
Mechanism Apache ShardingSphere uses ThreadLocal to manage sharding key values.</description>
