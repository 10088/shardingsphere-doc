 ElasticJob-Lite is deployed with business applications, and its life cycle is same as the business applications. It is a typical embedded lightweight architecture. ElasticJob-Lite is very suitable for ordinary Java applications with stable resource usage and simple deployment architecture. It can be understood as a Java development framework.
