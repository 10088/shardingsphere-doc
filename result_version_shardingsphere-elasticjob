> +## ElasticJob-Lite Implementation Principle
> +
> +ElasticJob-Lite does not have a job scheduling center node, but the programs based on the deployment job framework trigger the scheduling when the corresponding time point is reached.
> +The registration center is only used for job registration and monitoring information storage. The main job node is only used to handle functions such as sharding and cleaning.
> +
> +### Elastic Distributed Implementation
> +
> +- The first server went online to trigger the main server election. Once the main server goes offline, the election is triggered again, and the election process is blocked. Only when the main server election is completed, other tasks will be performed.
> +- When a job server goes online, it will automatically register the server information to the registry, and automatically update the server status when it goes offline.
> +- The re-sharding flag will be updated when the master node is elected, the server goes offline, and the total number of shards changes.
> +- When a scheduled task is triggered, if it needs to be sharded again, it will be sharded by the main server. The sharding process is blocked, and the task can be executed after the sharding ends.
> + If the main server goes offline during the sharding process, the master server will be elected first and then perform sharding.
> +- From the previous description, in order to maintain the stability of the job runtime, only the sharding status will be marked during the running process, and the sharding will not be re-sharded. Sharding can only occur before the next task is triggered.
> +- Each execution of sharding will sort instances by server IP to ensure that the sharding result will not produce large fluctuations.
> +- Realize the failover function, actively grab the unallocated shards after a certain server is executed, and actively search for available servers to perform tasks after a certain server goes offline.
> +
> +### Registry Data Structure
> +
> +The registration center creates a job name node under the defined namespace to distinguish different jobs, so once a job is created, the job name cannot be modified. If the name is modified, it will be regarded as a new job. 
> +There are 5 data sub-nodes under the job name node, namely config, instances, sharding, servers and leader.
> +
> +### config node
> +
> +Job configuration information, stored in YAML format.
> +
> +### instances node
> +
> +Job running instance information, the child node is the primary key of the current job running instance.
> +The primary key of the job running instance is composed of the IP address and PID of the job running server.
> +The primary keys of the job running instance are all ephemeral nodes, which are registered when the job instance is online and automatically cleaned up when the job instance is offline. The registry monitors the changes of these nodes to coordinate the sharding and high availability of distributed jobs.
> +You can write TRIGGER in the job running instance node to indicate that the instance will be executed once immediately.
> +
> +### sharding node
> +
> +Job sharding information. The child node is the sharding item sequence number, starting from zero and ending with the total number of shards minus one.
> +The child node of the sharding item sequence number stores detailed information. The child node under each shard is used to control and record the running status of the shard.
