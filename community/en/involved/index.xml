      <description>Two-factor authentication(2FA) Two factor authentication (2FA) refers to the authentication method that combines both passport, and an object (credit card, SMS phone, token or biomarkers as fingerprint) to identify a user. To ensure the security of the committer’s account, we need you to enable 2FA to sign in and contribute codes on GitHub.
More details, please refer to 2FA.
 To be noticed: If you do not enable 2FA, you will be removed from the project and unable to access our repositories and the fork from our private repository.</description>
